This folder contains the files about light competition dynamics of CAETÃŠ model. 
The dynamics are developed by Caio Fascina, Bianca Rius e Barbara Cardeli with collab by Luan Correa - members of LabTerra team,
and this files are desacopled of model and your logics are able to run off-line.

The parts of allocation (necessary to Light Competition) are based in LPJ-Model (Sitch et al., 2003; Smith 2001).

DESCRIPTION:

Light_Allometry.f90 -> contains the allometry equations and logic of light competition in Fortran90 language;

Light_Allometry.oy -> contains the allometry equations and logic of light competition in Python language;
